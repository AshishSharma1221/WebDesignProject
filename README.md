# Ashish Sharma's Portfolio Website

**Group Members:**  
- Ashish Sharma (worked alone)

## Design Principles
- **Proximity:** I applied the principle of proximity by grouping related content together, making sure that elements with a logical connection are visually close to each other.
- **Contrast:** I used contrast effectively to make important elements, like headings and buttons, stand out. This enhances readability and user interaction.
- **Typography:** I selected a clear and legible font combination to ensure readability across various devices and screen sizes.

## Accessibility Strategy
- I ensured that all images used in the website have appropriate alt attributes, which provide descriptive text for screen readers and improve overall accessibility.
- The HTML structure and semantics were carefully considered, using appropriate tags and nesting to ensure a meaningful and accessible document outline.

## SEO Strategy
- To optimize the website for search engines, I used descriptive title tags and meta descriptions for each page, helping search engines understand the content.
- Proper use of heading tags (h1, h2, h3) helps search engines identify the hierarchical structure of the content, improving its search ranking.
- Alt attributes for images not only enhance accessibility but also provide context to search engines about the image content.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The home page introducing myself and my expertise.
- `portfolio.html`: Showcase of my selected projects with descriptions and links.
- `contact.html`: Contact form for users to reach out to me.

## Additional Notes
- I've implemented a mobile-first approach for responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
- The website features clean and semantic HTML, along with carefully crafted CSS styles.
- All content, images, and design elements are original, and I've refrained from using CSS libraries or frameworks to practice creating layouts from scratch.
